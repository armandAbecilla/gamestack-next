# 🎮 GameStack

> 🗂️ A personal gaming backlog tracker to help keep your ever-growing library in check.

## 📖 Description

GameStack is a full-stack application I built to manage and track my personal gaming backlog — because let's face it, between **Steam**, **Xbox**, **PlayStation**, and **Nintendo**, the game pile is only getting taller.

What started as a simple **React** app has now evolved into a sleek **Next.js** application with modern tools and services under the hood.
